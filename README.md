         <p> Hello! My name is Alimamy Dadoss Kamara from Freetown Sierra Leone. 
         I hate it when people taking advantage on others. Therefore, i enjoy helping others having their right.
         I am currently studying Web Design and Development at the BYU (Brigham young university).
         I am a very passionate person who loves to learn new things and share my knowledge with others
         and I am excited to be part of this course. I hope to learn more about web design and development,
         and to improve my skills in creating websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing.
         I believe that web design is an important skill in today's digital world, and I am eager to learn more about it.
         I am looking forward to working with my classmates and instructors, and to contributing to the course in any way I can.
         I am excited to see what this course has in store for me.
